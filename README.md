### Hi there 👋

I'm Phong, or you can call me Krist. I'm currently a CSE undergraduate of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. You can contact me via , Zalo or Instagram (though I rarely use this one 🤣🤣)

- Some of my hobbies:
- 📖 Reading books (usually by English, as a way to improve my skill)
- 💻Play games (I'm playing Valorant 🔫🔫, some other FPS and visual novel game 🤣🤣)
- 🎥Watching (not really an enthusiast, but I love all kinds of superheroes movies and I'm a ROM-COM LOVER!!)

Future plans with updates:
- Mastering C++ (starter I think)
- Design Web and other Web-related stuff

...waiting for more updates... :))
